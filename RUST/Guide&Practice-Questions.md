# Rust Programming: Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Installation Guides

### Windows

- **Using Rustup (Recommended):**
    - Download and run [rustup-init.exe] from the official Rust website.
    - Follow on-screen instructions; choose default installation.
    - Update Rust regularly via Command Prompt:

```
rustup update
```


### macOS

- **Using Homebrew (Recommended for Mac):**

```
brew install rust
```

- **Using rustup:**
    - Run the following in Terminal:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```


### Linux

- **Using rustup:**
    - Open a terminal and run:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- **Update your PATH:**

```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```


## 2. Usage Examples

### Basic "Hello, World!"

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```


### Declaring Variables

```rust
let mut x = 5;
x = 10;
println!("{}", x);
```


### Functions

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```


### Control Flow

```rust
let number = 7;
if number > 5 {
    println!("Greater than 5");
} else {
    println!("Not greater than 5");
}
```


## 3. Platform Coverage

| Task | Windows | Linux/MacOS |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Install Rust | Run `rustup-init.exe` or use Chocolatey (`choco install rust`) [if installed] | Use `curl` as above or Homebrew on mac |
| Start Project | `cargo new projectname` | Same as Windows |
| Update Rust | `rustup update` | Same as Windows |
| IDE Integration | VS Code, CLion, IntelliJ Rust | Same as Windows (Cross-platform IDEs) |

## 4. Tooling Help

- **IDE Setup**
    - **VS Code:** Install the "rust-analyzer" extension.
    - **JetBrains:** Use "IntelliJ Rust" plugin for CLion, IntelliJ IDEA.
    - **Other Editors:** Vim and Emacs have Rust support via plugins.
- **Compilers \& Package Manager**
    - **Compiler:** `rustc`
    - **Package Manager:** `cargo` (handles build, test, dependency management)


## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Path Issues:** Ensure `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH.
- **Compiling Errors:** Read error messages carefully; Rust offers helpful suggestions.
- **Dependency Issues:** Delete `Cargo.lock` and run `cargo build` to regenerate.
- **Failed Installation:** Try running installation as admin (Windows) or with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) if permissions issues occur.
